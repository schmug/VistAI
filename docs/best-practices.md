# Development Best Practices

This document summarizes recommended workflows when contributing to VistAI.

## Keep Tests Green
- Run `npm test` after making changes to ensure the automated test suite passes.
- Run `npm run check` to verify TypeScript builds without errors.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use **two spaces** for indentation in all JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- Provide JSDoc comments for exported functions and modules to make the code self-documenting.
- Remove unused imports and keep the remaining ones grouped logically.

## Commit Etiquette
- Make sure your commits describe the purpose of the change.
- Reference related issues in the pull request description when applicable.

Adhering to these practices helps maintain a clean and stable codebase.
